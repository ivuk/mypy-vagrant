mypy-vagrant
============

A Vagrantfile and shell script combo that creates a VM with [mypy] (https://github.com/JukkaL/mypy) installed.

The shell script is really unsafe (no sanity checks etc), since I don't really care if anything breaks, with [Vagrant] (https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant) VMs being so easy to recreate.

YMMV disclaimer implied, as always.
